# ATMS 523 Module-8
## Patrick Burke Independent Module

The assignment is incomplete. I will update this `README.md` when complete.

My assignment follows the instructions provided in the syllabus and discussed during the Nov 07 synchronous lecture. Professor Nesbitt and I will meet to refine this project concept during the week of November 14.

The assignment has requirements: 
1.	Select a dataset, and reference it and appropriate literature using appropriate DOI numbers
2.	Perform data analysis in python with well-documented code
3.	Create a GitHub package that you use continually for version control
4.	Create a description of the motivation, approach, results, and conclusions that are included in a jupyter notebook that is part of your GitHub repository.
5.	Create a video presentation that summarizes your project in 5 minutes.

#### **Requirement 1: Dataset** _Incomplete_  
To be selected from the following options:  
* HURRICANE PATHS  
    - [NOAA NHC Atlantic HURDAT 2](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/): Atlantic hurricane database for track and wind speed at 6 hour intervals, 1851 - 2014 
    - Available at [OASIS HUB HURDAT 2](https://oasishub.co/dataset/hurdat-2-atlantic-hurricane-database). Could not find DOI. 
* PRECIPITATION   
    - ERA precip?
* LANDSLIDES    
    - [data.world](https://data.world/datasets/landslide)
    - [WB Data Catalogue](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037584)  
    - [NASA Data Viewer](https://data.nasa.gov/view/angv-aquq)  


#### **Requirement 2: Python code submittal** _Incomplete_  
My assignment will be completed in a Jupyter notebook called `M8HW_Burke.ipynb` which is located in GitHub repository here.

#### **Requirement 3: GitHub Package** _Complete_  
My assignment is saved in the GitHub repo called `M08-burke_independent-assignment`.

#### **Requirement 4: Project summary** _In development_  

Project concepts considered and rejected:
- Assess the distribution of rents within distance radii of locations in a city using rental prices [scraped from Craigslist](https://www.katepennington.org/clmethod) using Wayback Machine, using ML to fill in gaps in data. Determined it was too much work to code the data scraping.


#### **Requirement 5: Summary video** _Incomplete_  
A summary video of my research process and results will be found here when ready: _BLANK_
