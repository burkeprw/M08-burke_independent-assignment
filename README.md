# ATMS 523 Module-8
## Patrick Burke Independent Module

The assignment is complete(ish). My assignment follows the instructions provided in the syllabus and discussed during the Nov 07 synchronous lecture. Professor Nesbitt and I will meet to refine this project concept during the week of November 14.

The assignment has the following requirements: 
1.	Select a dataset, and reference it and appropriate literature using appropriate DOI numbers
2.	Perform data analysis in python with well-documented code
3.	Create a GitHub package that you use continually for version control
4.	Create a description of the motivation, approach, results, and conclusions that are included in a jupyter notebook that is part of your GitHub repository.
5.	Create a video presentation that summarizes your project in 5 minutes.

#### **Requirement 4: Project summary** _In development_  

Assessment of risk form extreme hydro-meteorological events on water resource, infrastructure, and human wellbeing is priority for managers and decision makers in Central America. Recently, integrated downscaled climate projections (dynamical and statistical using AR5 methods) were completed after a multi-year initiative led by the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) in Central America. The resulting dataset -- [Generation of Downscaled Scenarios for Central America](https://euroclimaplus.org/en/lao3/generation-of-regionalised-climate-change-scenarios-in-central-america) -- is available 
Our client owns untility infrastructure in the metropolitan areas of San Salvador, El Salvador. They are interested in assessing climate risk on substations, transmission infrastructure, and other built assets. My motivation with this project is to begin to get familiar with global precipitation and climate projection datasets that can be used in risk assessment.  

My approach to this project is to 


#### **Requirement 5: Summary video** _Incomplete_
