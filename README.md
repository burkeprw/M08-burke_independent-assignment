# ATMS 523 Module-8
## Patrick Burke Independent Module

The assignment is incomplete. I will update this `README.md` when complete.

My assignment follows the instructions provided in the syllabus and discussed during the Nov 07 synchronous lecture. Professor Nesbitt and I will meet to refine this project concept during the week of November 14.

The assignment has requirements: 
1.	Select a dataset, and reference it and appropriate literature using appropriate DOI numbers
2.	Perform data analysis in python with well-documented code
3.	Create a GitHub package that you use continually for version control
4.	Create a description of the motivation, approach, results, and conclusions that are included in a jupyter notebook that is part of your GitHub repository.
5.	Create a video presentation that summarizes your project in 5 minutes.

**Requirement 1: Dataset** _Incomplete_  
To be selected from the following options:
* NOAA NHC HURDAT: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/noaa/hurricane-database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/noaa/hurricane-database)    
    - Hurricane track and wind speed at 6 hour intervals, 1851 - 2014
* B  

**Requirement 2: Python code submittal** _Incomplete_  
My assignment will be completed in a Jupyter notebook called `M8HW_Burke.ipynb` which is located in GitHub repository here.

**Requirement 3: GitHub Package** _Complete_
My assignment is saved in the GitHub repo called `burke-independent-assignment`.

**Requirement 4: Project summary** _In development_  


Project concepts considered and rejected:
- Assess the distribution of rents within distance radii of locations in a city using rental prices [scraped from Craigslist](https://www.katepennington.org/clmethod) using Wayback Machine, using ML to fill in gaps in data. Determined it was too much work to code the data scraping.


**Requirement 5: Summary video** _Incomplete_
* A summary video of my research process and results will be found here when ready: _BLANK_
